## Best Practices

- When in doubt about a transaction, always check the Flutterwave Dashboard to confirm the status of a transaction.
- Always ensure you keep your API keys securely and privately. Do not share with anyone.
- Ensure you change from the default secret hash on the Wordpress admin and apply same on the Flutterwave Dashboard.
- Always ensure you install the most recent version of the Flutterwave WooCommerce plugin.
